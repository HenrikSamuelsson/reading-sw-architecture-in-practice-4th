# Chapter 1 Discussion Questions Answers

Answers to discussion questions from chapter 1 in the book Software Architecture in Practice, Fourth Edition.

## Answer Question 1

Definition of software architecture from the book:

> The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system. These structures comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both.

There are other definitions of software architecture.

IEEE 1471:

> Architecture is the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution.

Synopsys, what is software architecture:

> The software architecture of a system depicts the systemâ€™s organization or structure, and provides an explanation of how it behaves.

Hayes-Roth, 1994:

> ..an abstract system specification consisting primarily of functional components described in terms of their behaviors and interfaces and component-component interconnections.

Definitions of software architecture can include considerations like rationale for decisions or how the architecture will evolve over time. This can be considered to be meta information and not strictly necessary. But there are benefits with adding this type of information due to that over time we tend to forget why a decision was taken and keeping notes on what to do next is useful if the work shall be handed over to someone new.
